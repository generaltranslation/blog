## Overview

In **gt-next 6.4.0**, we've introduced locale aliasing. This little feature allows users to overwrite any canonical locale with an alias.

---

## Setup

In order to facilitate this, we've repurposed the `code` field in the `customMapping` parameter from the configuration. The `alias locale` is the locale that will be used in your codebase. The `canonical locale` is the locale that will be used in the API.

For example, General Translation uses `zh` instead of `cn`. If you wanted to use `cn` in your codebase for Chinese, then `cn` would be your alias locale and `zh` would be your canonical locale.

```json
"customMapping": {
  "cn": {
    "code": "zh"
  }
}
```

Additionally, we have decided to move custom mapping from `next.config.js` to `gt.config.json`. This allows other libraries (`gtx-cli` and `gt-react`) to make use of this feature as well.

## Customization

Because we are reusing the `customMapping` feature, you can further customize your alias locale. For example, say that you want your `cn` alias to also be titled as "Mandarin" instead of "Chinese":

```json
"customMapping": {
  "cn": {
    "code": "zh",
    "languageName": "Mandarin"
  }
}
```
