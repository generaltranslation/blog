## Overview

We are very excited to announce the release of @general-translation/compiler v1.0.0.

As we stated in our `gt-next@6.2.0` release, we believe the future of i18n libraries lies in build-time processing. Earlier this year, we released a SWC plugin for `gt-next` that enabled optimizations like compile-time hashing and better dev-time string translations. While this provided an excellent (albeit intense) introduction to compiler plugins for our team, its scope was limited to Next.js projects only.

We're following through on our commitment to build-time processing by releasing this general-purpose React compiler plugin. This means all the build-time optimizations from `gt-next` are now available to every `gt-react` user!

## Setup

### Configuration

| Option               | Type    | Default  | Description                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compileTimeHash`    | boolean | `true`   | Enables compile-time hashing                                                                         |
| `disableBuildChecks` | boolean | `false`  | Disables error throwing when invalid library usage is detected                                       |
| `logLevel`           | string  | `'warn'` | Controls the level of logging. Options: `'silent'` \| `'error'` \| `'warn'` \| `'info'` \| `'debug'` |

**Note**:
For `gt-next`, in order to satisfy a backward compatibility requirement, if you set `compileTimeHash` to `false`, the entire plugin will be disabled.

### gt-react

You first need to install the package:

```bash
npm install @generaltranslation/compiler
```

**Vite**

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { vite as gtCompiler } from '@generaltranslation/compiler'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [gtCompiler()],
})
```

**Webpack**

```js
// webpack.config.js
const { webpack: gtCompiler } = require('@generaltranslation/compiler')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [gtCompiler()],
}
```

**Rollup**

```js
// rollup.config.js
import { rollup as gtCompiler } from '@generaltranslation/compiler'

export default {
  plugins: [gtCompiler()],
}
```

### gt-next

You do not need to install any additional packages.

For `gt-next`, we're deprecating `experimentalSwcPluginOptions` in favor of the new `experimentalCompilerOptions` field. The key difference is that you must now specify which compiler type to use: `'swc'` or `'babel'`. The `'swc'` compiler is used by default, but you can enable the new Babel-based compiler by setting the `type` field to `'babel'`.

```js
// next.config.js
import { withGTConfig } from 'gt-next'

export default withGTConfig(nextConfig, {
  experimentalCompilerOptions: {
    type: 'babel',
  },
})
```

## Conclusion

We have much more work planned for the compiler, so expect frequent updates in the coming months.
