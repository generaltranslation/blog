## Overview

In **gt-next 6.2.0**, we've taken a big step toward moving processing from runtime to build time through an **SWC plugin**.
This approach unlocks new capabilities like compile-time hashing, pre-rendered translations, and stricter validation — all without adding runtime overhead.

To keep things focused, we started small with three key improvements.

- **Compile-time hashing**
- **Translation on demand**
- **Build-time linting rules**

---

## Compile-Time Hashing

While a relatively small optimization, we now perform **hash calculations at build time** instead of at runtime.  
Functions like `getGT()` and server-side `<T>` no longer need to compute and cache hashes on every call, resulting in more consistent performance.

---

## Translation on Demand

One of the biggest pain points for developers has been refreshing the page during development to see real-time string updates.

`getGT()` and `useGT()` follow the familiar i18n pattern:

```tsx title="page.tsx" copy
export default function Page() {
  const t = useGT()
  // const t = await getGT(); for server-side

  return (
    <>
      {t('some content to translate')}
      {t('some other content to translate')}
    </>
  )
}
```

We deliberately kept `t()` synchronous to match other i18n libraries.
The downside was a `two-step translation process`:

    1.	Register the text with the API.
    2.	Wait for a second render to display the translated result.

Now, thanks to the compiler, translatable content is scanned ahead of time and passed directly into `useGT()` or `getGT()` at compile time.
This means translations are immediately available at runtime — no page refreshes.

## Build-Time Linting

Previously, detecting incorrect usage of `<T>` components required running `gtx-cli` with a custom linter.
This created inconsistencies between **development** and **production** behavior.

With 6.2.0, linting rules are now enforced directly in the SWC plugin.
If any translatable content isn't wrapped in a `<T>` component, you'll get a **build-time error**, ensuring issues are caught early.

---

## Why SWC (for now)?

Our transition from runtime to build time is still in its early stages.
We're starting with Next.js, but plan to support other frameworks soon.
Babel plugins offering the same functionality are already on the roadmap.

`gt-next 6.2.0` lays the groundwork for a faster, more reliable translation workflow.
By shifting logic to build time, we're reducing runtime complexity while making translations more immediate and predictable.
