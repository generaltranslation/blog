## Overview

In **gtx-cli 2.3.0**, we updated the behavior of the `translate` and `upload` commands and increased visibility into the translation pipeline.

---

## Translate

Historically, `translate` both triggered translations **and** ran a one-time project setup in the background (generating context and glossary you see on your [dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/dashboard/project/context)).

On smaller projects this was fast; on larger codebases, setup could take long enough to trigger a timeout, making it look like there was a translation failure.

While users were given the impression that `translate` failed, setup would complete asynchronously and translations would be generated but not downloaded, leading to incomplete and confusing UX.

### Setup

Setup is now a separate step. We optimized it to make timeouts rare.

But because we realize setup can still fail, translation no longer “depends” on setup finishing. Now the pipeline looks something like this:

- **Upload:** send files and confirm success.
- **Setup (only if needed):** start a setup job and wait; if it fails or times out, we move on.
- **Translate:** create translation jobs based on the files you already uploaded.

If setup completes in time, great. If it fails or times out, we continue and tell you what happened. You still get translations.

What you'll see when you run `npx gtx-cli translate`:

```bash
Starting translation...

Files to translate:
  - your/file/path.mdx
  - ...

Uploading files to General Translation API...
✔ Files uploaded successfully

Setting up project...

# If setup succeeds
Setup successfully completed.

# If setup times out
⚠ Setup timed out — proceeding without setup: Timed out while waiting for setup generation

# If setup fails
⚠ Setup failed — proceeding without setup: <error message>

# In any case, we continue to translations
Creating 12 translation(s)
[0/12] translations completed
your/file/path.mdx [es]
```

With this change, we can now guarantee that your translations will generate even in the off chance setup fails.

We also like that it gives you more visiblity into how and where we generate the content that influences your translations, and it makes adding new setup steps worry-free since they will never stop translation from happening.

## Upload

We've also made `upload` more flexible. Earlier versions assumed you always sent a source file together with its translations. That doesn't fit every workflow. Now you can:

- Upload **source files only** (no translations yet).
- Upload **sources + translations together**.

We still auto-detect translations from your repo structure and config. Once you upload, you'll immediately see files in your [dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/dashboard/project/translations).

If this is your `gt.config.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultLocale": "en",
  "locales": ["es", "fr"],
  "files": {
    "json": { "include": ["src/i18n/en/**/*.json"] }
  }
}
```

Running `npx gtx-cli upload`:

```bash
# Sources only (no local translations found):
Starting upload...

Files to upload:
  - src/i18n/en/common.json -> es, fr
  ...

Uploading 1 file(s) to General Translation...
✔ Files uploaded successfully

Done!

# In your dashboard, you'll see:
#   src/i18n/en/common.json
# with no corresponding translations yet.
```

If local translations are present and auto-detected:

```bash
Starting upload...

Files to upload:
  - src/i18n/en/common.json -> es, fr

Uploading 3 file(s) to General Translation...
✔ Files uploaded successfully

Done!

# In your dashboard, you'll see:
#   src/i18n/en/common.json
# plus translated versions in Spanish and French in the locale dropdown.
```

If a locale's translation file is missing, we upload the source and skip the missing translation.

If you have local translations but only want to upload sources, remove locales from `gt.config.json` before running `upload`:

```json
{
  "defaultLocale": "en",
  "locales": [],
  "files": {
    "json": { "include": ["src/i18n/en/**/*.json"] }
  }
}
```

### Uploads overwrite existing translations

> **Heads-up:** When you run `upload`, any translated file we detect and upload for a given file/locale **replaces** what's currently stored for that file/locale.
>
> - To upload sources only, remove target locales from `gt.config.json` before `upload`.
> - If you need to review changes first, use a separate project or export current translations before uploading.
> - Missing translations are skipped; present translations are replaced.
