Fernando is a software engineer who likes building where language meets AI.

He studied Computer Science at Princeton University with a minor in Italian language and culture.  
Born in Mexico but raised in the US, Fernando grew up constantly switching between Spanish and English. This taught him how meaning survives across languages and made him excited to learn more.

At General Translation, he's focused on shipping translations that are incredibly accurate and contextually aware.
